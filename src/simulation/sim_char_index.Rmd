To test simulated batch effects there batch characteristics were analyzed and compared to the real datasets that were used to estimate the simulations parameter. 
  
Batch characteristics of the simulated datasets are shown here: 

```{r dataset name, include=FALSE}
sce_list = unlist(c(list(strsplit(params$data_names, ","))))
create_link <- c(
    "`r paste0('+ [', '{{sce_nam}}', '](simulation_', '{{sce_nam}}', '.html)')`"
  )

sim_links <- lapply(sce_list, 
  function(sce_nam) knitr::knit_expand(text = create_link)
)
```


`r knitr::knit(text = unlist(sim_links))`
